1-How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
One way to make sure that the code, program, or software is functional is to perform testing on that code.  
Junit testing is one of many example tests that you can perform to check the functionality of your code.  To make
sure that code is secure we can make sure that we incorporate input validation so we can prevent things like injection attacks.

2-How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
To incorporate the user needs we have to understand the requirements that the user has for the system.  We can do this by conducting 
interviews, using surveys, or watching how they perform their tasks day to day. 

3-How do I approach designing software?
How I approach designing software is I first see what is needed for the system then I write down on paper in English what I need the system to do
and how I should do it, after that I start to code the system applying the logic that I just went through on the paper.
